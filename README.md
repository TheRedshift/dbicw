# dbicw
A database management system implemented in php that handles an sql database of music data.
The SQL dump in this repo contains a small amount of sample data - just enough to muck around with the functions. All of the database connections in the code are setup with XAMPP defaults (username = "root", password = "", tablename = DBICW).
